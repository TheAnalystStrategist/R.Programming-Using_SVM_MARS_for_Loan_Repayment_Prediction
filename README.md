# R.Programming-Using_SVM_MARS_for_Loan_Repayment_Prediction
The goal of this project was to use Support Vector Machine to specifically identify the predictors that are most important for predicting whether a loan will be fully paid or not. To achieve this, I had to build a model that accurately predicts a loan will be fully paid or not and to understand the relationship between predictors and target audience. Below were my key takeaways and recommendations:
1) A strong relationship between higher FICO scores and consistent loan repayment by customers.
2) Customers with lower FICO scores were found to have higher interest rates, implying that lending to these individuals carries a higher level of risk.
3) Priority must be given to customers with a higher FICO scores to decrease the probability of default and increase the likelihood of successful repayment.
4) Loan applications from customers seeking financing for home improvement, education, major purchases, or small business purposes had a higher repayment rate than those seeking debt consolidation or credit card financing.
